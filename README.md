# SIR-Model-Covid-Delhi
The SIR model is one of the most basic models for describing the temporal
dynamics of an infectious disease in a population. It compartmentalizes
people into one of three categories: those who are Susceptible to the disease,
those who are currently Infectious, and those who have Recovered (with
immunity). At its most basic level, the SIR model is a set of equations that
describes the number (or proportion) of people in each compartment at every
point in time. The SIR model is often represented with the following flow
diagram that shows the three states (S, I, and R) and arrows depicting the
direction of flow between the states.
